# School of Hard Knocks
Welcome to my learning repository where I document my journey to becoming a better developer. Each branch in this repository represents a unique technology that I am learning and provides a project that showcases my skills.

I am a passionate learner and love to explore new technologies. With each project, I strive to challenge myself and learn something new.

Here are some of the technologies that I have been working on:

## UnderstandingOAuth: 
This branch showcases my knowledge and understanding of OAuth authentication. It includes a project where I have integrated OAuth with a web application.

## ReactShoppingCart: 
This branch highlights my experience with React and building a shopping cart application. It includes features such as adding items to the cart, updating the quantity, and checking out.

## NodeExpressAPI: 
This branch showcases my knowledge of building APIs with Node.js and Express. It includes a simple REST API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete records.

I am constantly learning and updating my skills. Follow me on my journey as I explore new technologies and improve my skills as a developer.
