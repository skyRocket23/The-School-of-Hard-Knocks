#School_of_Hard_Knocks
This repository is a collection of projects that I'm working on to learn and 
understand different concepts and technologies. 
Each project is organized in its own branch and includes a README file that outlines the purpose of the project, 
the tools and technologies used, and any other relevant information.


#Contributing
As this repository is for my own learning, I'm not currently accepting contributions from others. 
However, if you see an error or have a suggestion for improvement, please feel free to open an issue on the project's branch.
